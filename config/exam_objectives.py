"""
EX200 Exam Objectives — formal domain definitions with weights and mapped
categories, per exam version.

Domains 1-8 are this simulator's own grouping of the official study points;
domain 9 (Containers) exists only in v9, where "Manage containers" is its own
section on Red Hat's page. Weights are the simulator's estimate — Red Hat does
not publish per-section weightings.

Call get_objectives() rather than touching the version dicts directly, so a
session always sees the syllabus it is being graded against.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# v9 differences, taken from Red Hat's EX200 (RHEL 9) study points:
#
#   - No "Manage software" section and no Flatpak at all. Software install
#     lives under "Deploy, configure, and maintain systems".
#   - "List, create, delete partitions on MBR and GPT disks" (v10: GPT only).
#   - "Create and configure set-GID directories for collaboration"
#     (dropped in v10).
#   - "Schedule tasks using at and cron" — no systemd timer units.
#   - "Diagnose and address routine SELinux policy violations"
#     (dropped in v10).
#   - "Manage containers" is a section of its own — domain 9 below.
#
# Weight is redistributed to give containers ~10%, taken proportionally from
# the domains that lose objectives in v9 (software, systemd/services).
